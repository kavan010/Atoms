--- Simulating Atoms in C++ ---
Hi guys, this is the pre-dev statement for my next project of simulating atoms in C++.
My goal is to start of with a 2D -> 3D bohr rutherford model, and work up to the quantum model
working with the { s p d f } orbitals and electron distrubitions
This project will show atoms in 3D, aswell as compounds composed of many atoms
